# Gold Analysis Project 💰
## 📝 Overview
This project analyzes historical gold futures prices to compute moving averages, returns, and visualization using Python, pandas, numpy, and matplotlib.

**Author**: Mohd Zubair

**Date**: 16 August 2025

## 🎯 Key Features
● Computes 20, 50, and 200-day moving averages.

● Calculates daily and cumulative returns.

● Generates visualizations: price trends, returns histogram, and cumulative returns.

● Saves summary statistics (total return, volatility) to a text file.+.


## 🛠 Skills Demonstrated
● **Python**: Data processing and scripting.

● **Data Analysis**:  Cleaning and Transforming financial data with 'pandas' and 'numpy'.

● **Visualization**: Creating insightful charts with 'matplotlib'.

● **Finance**: Calculating moving averages, returns, and volatility.

## 📊 Prerequisites
● Python 3.8+

● Libraries: 'pandas', 'numpy', 'matplotlib'

'''bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib

## 🚀 Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   '''bash
   git clone https://github.com/MohdZubair06/gold-analysis.git
2. Place gold_data.csv in the project directory (see Data Format)
3. Run the script (ensure Prerequisites are met):
   python gold-analysis.py

## 📈 Outputs
● Charts: 
'1_price_ma.png' (price trends),
'2_returns_hist.png' (returns distribution),
'3_cum_return.png (cumulative returns).

● Summary: 
'summary.txt' with metrics like total return and volatility.

## 🔬 Customization
Extend the project with AI/ML techniques:

● Add predictive models like LSTM or ARIMA for gold price forecasting.

● Incorporate feature engineering (e.g., volatility indicators) for ML models.

● Analyze multiple assets (e.g., stocks) by adapting the input CSV.

● Create interactive visualizations with `plotly` for enhanced data exploration.

## 📚 Academic Relevance
This project prepares me for AI/ML studies by:

● **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and transforming financial data.

● **Time-Series Analysis**: Computing trends and returns.

● **Machine Learning Potential**: Enabling predictive modeling and feature engineering.

## 📜 Usage
This project is intended for academic review and portfolio demonstration.
